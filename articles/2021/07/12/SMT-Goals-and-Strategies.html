SMT Goals and Strategies
</h1>
<p class="subtitle">
July 12, 2021
</p>
<p>SMT/SAT problems are in general <em>undecidable</em>: basically we cannot know if we can get even an answer. The <em>search space</em> is in general infinite.</p>
<p>But several concrete problems have a reduced space and <em>may be tractable</em>: while theoretical really hard, we can find a solution in a reasonable time.</p>
<p>Still, a solver may need some extra help to navigate across the search space.</p>
<p>A <em>strategy</em> is a <em>guide</em> that hopefully will lead to a solution (<code><span class="highlight-candombe-inline"><span class="n">sat</span></span></code> or <code><span class="highlight-candombe-inline"><span class="n">unsat</span></span></code>) in a <em>reasonable time</em> using a <em>reasonable amount of resources</em>.</p>
<p>It is quite an art and the concepts were around for more than 30 years.</p>
<p>This post is a quick overview of concepts like <em>strategies</em>, <em>tactics</em>, <em>tacticals</em>, <em>merit order</em>, <em>cost functions</em>, <em>heuristic functions</em>, <em>goals</em>, <em>approximations</em>, <em>redundancy control</em>, <em>search strategies</em>, <em>probes</em> and a few more.</p>
<p>Quite a heavy post I’m afraid.<!--more--></p>
<h2 id="goals">Goals</h2>
<p>A <em>goal</em> is what we want to solve. Depending of the underlying <em>theory</em> this can be:</p>
<ul>
<li>a set of inequations, and we want to see if there is a solution to them.</li>
<li>a set of propositional clauses, and want to see if exist propositional variables to make them true.</li>
<li>even a combination of theories are possible.</li>
</ul>
<p>Let be the <em>goal set</em> \({G}\) consisting of a single goal \(G\):</p>
$$
G: [ a = b + 1, (a < 0 ∨ a > 0), b > 3 ]
$$
<p>The goal is to see if there is an <em>assignment</em> for \(a\) and \(b\) such those inequations hold or if there is a <em>contradiction</em> so it doesn’t exist such assignment.</p>
<p>In the first case we say that the such assignment <em>satisfies</em> the goal (the solver returned <code><span class="highlight-candombe-inline"><span class="n">sat</span></span></code>); in the second case the problem is <em>unsatisfied</em> (<code><span class="highlight-candombe-inline"><span class="n">unsat</span></span></code>).</p>
<h2 id="tactics">Tactics</h2>
<p>A <em>tactic</em> tries to solve the goal or at least tries to make it easier to solve.</p>
<p>The tactic <code><span class="highlight-candombe-inline"><span class="n">elim</span></span></code>, for example, eliminates intermedian variables such given \(a = b + 1\) the tactic can eliminate \(a\) and replace it by \(b + 1\).</p>
<p>It doesn’t solve the problem, but it makes it a little easier to solve later.</p>
<p>A tactic may have 4 possible results:</p>
<ul>
<li><code><span class="highlight-candombe-inline"><span class="n">sat</span></span></code>: the tactic resolved the goal and returned a <em>model</em>, an <em>assignment</em> that satisfies the goal.</li>
<li><code><span class="highlight-candombe-inline"><span class="n">unsat</span></span></code>: the tactic found a contradiction and returned a <em>proof</em> of why the goal is <code><span class="highlight-candombe-inline"><span class="n">unsat</span></span></code>.</li>
<li><code><span class="highlight-candombe-inline"><span class="n">unknown</span></span></code>: the tactic returns a set of <em>subgoals</em>, hopefully being simpler to solve.</li>
<li><code><span class="highlight-candombe-inline"><span class="n">fail</span></span></code>: the tactic didn’t work.</li>
</ul>
<p>In this case the tactic <code><span class="highlight-candombe-inline"><span class="n">elim</span></span></code> returns <code><span class="highlight-candombe-inline"><span class="n">unknown</span></span></code> and the following 1-goal set:</p>
$$
G_1: [ (b + 1 < 0 ∨ b + 1 > 0), b > 3]
$$
<p>The tactic <code><span class="highlight-candombe-inline"><span class="n">split</span><span class="o">-</span><span class="ow">or</span></span></code> takes each goal and <em>splits</em> the disjunctives generating a <em>subgoal</em> per case. Like before this tactic returns <code><span class="highlight-candombe-inline"><span class="n">unknown</span></span></code> and the subgoals (an ordered set):</p>
$$
G_2: [ b + 1 < 0, b > 3]    \\
G_3: [ b + 1 > 0, b > 3]
$$
<h3 id="approximations">Approximations</h3>
<p>The tactics may <em>under-approximate</em> by changing the initial goal by another, hopeful simpler, which if it is <code><span class="highlight-candombe-inline"><span class="n">sat</span></span></code> then the initial goal is <code><span class="highlight-candombe-inline"><span class="n">sat</span></span></code> too.</p>
<p>An example could be adding more restrictions or assumptions: if the new <em>more restrictive</em> problem is <code><span class="highlight-candombe-inline"><span class="n">sat</span></span></code> then the initial is <code><span class="highlight-candombe-inline"><span class="n">sat</span></span></code> too. This is known as <em>strengthening</em>.</p>
<p>However, if a <em>under-approximate</em> tactic yields <code><span class="highlight-candombe-inline"><span class="n">unsat</span></span></code> we cannot say anything about the initial goal.</p>
<p>The tactics may also <em>over-approximate</em> by making a new goal <em>less restrictive</em>: if the new problem is <code><span class="highlight-candombe-inline"><span class="n">unsat</span></span></code> then the initial goal is <code><span class="highlight-candombe-inline"><span class="n">unsat</span></span></code> too; if the new problem is <code><span class="highlight-candombe-inline"><span class="n">sat</span></span></code> however, we cannot say anything else.</p>
<p>An example could be removing restrictions or assumptions known as <em>weakening</em>.</p>
<h2 id="goals-sets">Goals sets</h2>
<p>In [2] the returned set by a tactic is in fact two: the set of goals <em>added</em> and the set of goals <em>deleted</em> from the initial goal set. The <em>deleted</em> set not only deletes the goals but also <em>marks</em> them to make sure they are not readded later (called <em>redundacy control</em> [1])</p>
<p>In [1] the tactic are categorized as <em>ordering-based</em> if their input is a <em>set of objects</em> (all the goals) and <em>subgoal-reduction</em> if their input is a <em>single object</em> (a single goal).</p>
<p>The first operates over all the goals in each step and it is where it makes possible to <em>add</em> or <em>remove</em> goals from the set.</p>
<p>On the other hand the second operates over each goal at time.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Note: [1] uses <em>ordering-based</em> and <em>subgoal-reduction</em> to categorize <em>strategies</em> and not <em>tactics</em> but it seems reasonable to stretch a little the definition.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="tactics-products-models-and-proofs">Tactics’ products: models and proofs</h3>
<p>Note that subgoals \(G_2\) and \(G_3\) comes from a <em>disjunctive</em>:</p>
<ul>
<li>at least one must be true to declare the parent goal <code><span class="highlight-candombe-inline"><span class="n">G_1</span></span></code> <code><span class="highlight-candombe-inline"><span class="n">sat</span></span></code></li>
<li>all of them must be false to declare the parent goal <code><span class="highlight-candombe-inline"><span class="n">G_1</span></span></code> <code><span class="highlight-candombe-inline"><span class="n">unsat</span></span></code></li>
</ul>
<p>In addition the tactic must build a model from <em>one</em> of the subgoal <code><span class="highlight-candombe-inline"><span class="n">sat</span></span></code> and a proof from <em>all</em> the subgoals when they are <code><span class="highlight-candombe-inline"><span class="n">unsat</span></span></code>.</p>
<p>This is handled by the tactic’s <em>model converter</em> and <em>proof converter</em> functions, <code><span class="highlight-candombe-inline"><span class="n">mc</span></span></code> and <code><span class="highlight-candombe-inline"><span class="n">pc</span></span></code> for short.</p>
<h2 id="proof-graphs-search-graphs">Proof graphs / Search graphs</h2>
<p>The successive application of tactics generates subgoals that induce a tree structure know as the <em>proof tree</em>:</p>
<p><figure><figcaption><span markdown='1'>
</span></figcaption>
<object style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" class='' align='middle' data='/img/z3/prooftree.svg' type='image/svg+xml'></object></figure></p>
<p>Formally, to say proof <em>tree</em> we need to restrict the tactics to not generate repeated goals (so we don’t have cycles).</p>
<p>Having then a <em>single</em> starting goal, the <em>successive application</em> of the tactics forms a <em>tree</em>.</p>
<p>We can extend this and have <em>multiple</em> starting goals in which case we will have an <em>acyclic graph</em> like described in [3]. (in [3] is more specific and refers to <em>goals</em> and <em>tactics</em> as <em>states</em> (of a proof) and <em>rules of induction</em> but they are the same idea).</p>
<p><figure><figcaption><span markdown='1'>
</span></figcaption>
<object style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" class='' align='middle' data='/img/z3/tree2.svg' type='image/svg+xml'></object></figure></p>
<p>With <em>subgoal-reduction</em> tactics, the graph is generated edge by edge; with <em>ordering-based</em> tactics, the graph is generated by multiple edges at time.</p>
<p>Note that the generation (or walking) of this graph is non-deterministic: why you would the solver choose to explore the edge/edges from one node/nodes instead of the other?</p>
<p>To make it deterministic we have a way to <em>choose</em> which exploration do and in which <em>order</em>. This is the <em>search strategy</em> based on a <em>merit order</em>.</p>
<h2 id="search-strategy">Search strategy</h2>
<p>In [3] it is introduced the notion of <em>merit order</em>, a relationship between every pair of nodes in the graph: \(g_i\) ≼ \(g_j\)</p>
<p>This <em>merit order</em> could have different definitions:</p>
<ul>
<li>\(g_i\) ≼ \(g_j\) if \(i\) ≤ \(j\) (a <em>breadth first</em> order)</li>
<li>\(g_i\) ≼ \(g_j\) if \(c(g_i)\) ≤ \(c(g_j)\) for some <em>cost function</em> \(c(n)\) ≥ \(0\).</li>
<li>\(g_i\) ≼ \(g_j\) if \(g_i\) is in a predecesor layer or level than \(g_j\) (\(g_i\) is better than \(g_j\) because it required less applications of tactics)</li>
<li>\(g_i\) ≼ \(g_j\) if \(g_i\) is in a successor layer than \(g_j\) (a <em>depth first</em> order).</li>
</ul>
<p>A <em>search strategy</em> could use the <em>merit order</em> to <em>schedule</em> which goal process next:</p>
<ul>
<li>\(g_i\) is processed <em>before</em> than <em>any</em> \(g_i\) that has a worse merit than \(g_i\) (\(g_i\) ≼ \(g_j\)) <em>and</em> worse than any <em>ancestor</em> of \(g_i\).</li>
<li>if \(g_i\) is generated <em>before</em> than \(g_j\) then \(g_j\) or any of its ancestors has a worse merit than \(g_i\).</li>
</ul>
<p>A particular case is when the <em>merit order</em> is based on a <em>cost function</em> \(c()\) and an <em>heuristic function</em> \(h()\).</p>
<p>If \(c(g_i)\) is the cost to reach \(g_i\), then \(h(g_i)\) <em>estimates</em> the additional cost that would take to go from \(g_i\) to a <em>trivial goal</em>, one that is ⊤ (trivially <code><span class="highlight-candombe-inline"><span class="n">sat</span></span></code>) or ⊥ (trivially <code><span class="highlight-candombe-inline"><span class="n">unsat</span></span></code>).</p>
<p>The estimation can be seen as how much more will take to get to a final resolution.</p>
<p>\(h()\) may <em>under-estimate</em> the additional cost or <em>over-estimate</em> it.</p>
<h2 id="tacticals">Tacticals</h2>
<p>While tactics operate at the goal set level, <em>tacticals</em> operate one level higher: they operate with the tactics.</p>
<p>Think in tacticals as functions that receive tactics as their arguments.</p>
<p><code><span class="highlight-candombe-inline"><span class="n">repeat</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">t</span><span class="p">)</span></span></code> is a tactical that takes a tactic and applies it several times until the tactic <code><span class="highlight-candombe-inline"><span class="n">fails</span></span></code> so <code><span class="highlight-candombe-inline"><span class="n">repeat</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">elim</span><span class="p">)</span></span></code> applies <code><span class="highlight-candombe-inline"><span class="n">elim</span></span></code> over and over until no other change happens.</p>
<p><code><span class="highlight-candombe-inline"><span class="n">then</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">t1</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">t2</span><span class="p">)</span></span></code> applies <code><span class="highlight-candombe-inline"><span class="n">t1</span></span></code> and if it didn’t fail applies <code><span class="highlight-candombe-inline"><span class="n">t2</span></span></code>.</p>
<p><code><span class="highlight-candombe-inline"><span class="n">orelse</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">t1</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">t2</span><span class="p">)</span></span></code> applies <code><span class="highlight-candombe-inline"><span class="n">t1</span></span></code> and if it failed applies <code><span class="highlight-candombe-inline"><span class="n">t2</span></span></code>.</p>
<p>This is a handy way to build the <em>strategy</em> to solve the problem in terms of tacticals and tactics.</p>
<h2 id="probes-or-formula-measures">Probes or formula measures</h2>
<p>A <em>probe</em> or <em>formula measure</em> is a tactic which does not modify the goal set but it fails or not based on attributes or properties of the current goal set.</p>
<p>A <em>probe</em> could count how many variables a formula has or if the inequations follow are written in a particular way.</p>
<p>Based on a <em>probe</em> one tactic or other could be applied next.</p>
<p>For example <code><span class="highlight-candombe-inline"><span class="n">orelse</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">then</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">c1</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">t1</span><span class="p">),</span> <span class="n">t2</span><span class="p">)</span></span></code> applies <code><span class="highlight-candombe-inline"><span class="n">t1</span></span></code> <em>if</em> the probe (or check) <code><span class="highlight-candombe-inline"><span class="n">c1</span></span></code> didn’t fail otherwise <code><span class="highlight-candombe-inline"><span class="n">t2</span></span></code> is applied.</p>
<h2 id="reasoning-engines">Reasoning engines</h2>
<p>At the end the goals needs to be translated into a suitable format and sent to the <em>reasoning engine</em> for the final resolution.</p>
<p>For example each inequation can be seen as a <em>propositional variable</em> and the problem gets reduced to a SAT problem.</p>
$$
G_2: [ b + 1 < 0, b > 3]    \\
G_3: [ b + 1 > 0, b > 3]    \\
                            \\
G_2 → C_2: [ p ∧ q]    \\
G_3 → C_3: [ r ∧ q]
$$
<p>Notice that the conversion was not 1-to-1: \(p\) and \(r\) could be \(true\) when the original inequations \(b + 1 < 0\) and \(b + 1 > 0\) cannot.</p>
<p>The solver then needs to verify if the solution found by the engine is corrects and make the proper changes to the formulation and try again.</p>
<p>And this is expensive. That’s the idea behind the strategy: make the search space smaller and try to make the conversion from the arbitrary initial <em>theory</em> to the theory supported by the engine.</p>
<h3 id="reasoning-engines-as-tactics">Reasoning engines as tactics</h3>
<p>If the solver supports more than one reasoning engine, the engine could be seen as a tactic and which engine to use being determined by the strategy like any other tactic.</p>
<h2 id="strategies">Strategies</h2>
<p>Finally!</p>
<p>A <em>strategy</em> is a series of <em>tacticals</em> and <em>tactics</em> (including the <em>reasoning engine</em> and possibly <em>probes</em>) that combined hope to solve a particular problem: determine if it is <code><span class="highlight-candombe-inline"><span class="n">sat</span></span></code> and get a <em>model</em> of it or it is <code><span class="highlight-candombe-inline"><span class="n">unsat</span></span></code> and get a <em>proof</em> of why.</p>
<p>The <em>search space</em> is in general infinite so it is not possible to solve any arbitrary problem but a strategy may <em>guide</em> the search process into the direction that hopefully will lead to a solution (<code><span class="highlight-candombe-inline"><span class="n">sat</span></span></code> or <code><span class="highlight-candombe-inline"><span class="n">unsat</span></span></code>) in a <em>reasonable time</em> using a <em>reasonable amount of resources</em>.</p>
<p>The search space is generated and explored on each tactic application: multiple edges at time when a <em>ordered-based</em> tactic is used, a single edge when it is a <em>subgoal-reduction</em> tactic.</p>
<p>Adding new goals <em>expands</em> the <em>active</em> search space; removing goals not only <em>reduces</em> the space but also prevents future tactics to readd the removed goal offering a <em>redundancy control</em>.</p>
<p>The application of the tactics is nondeterministic and an <em>well founded order</em> must prioritize which tactic next.</p>
<p>This is where a <em>merit order</em>, a <em>cost function</em> and a <em>heuristic function</em> play a role to prioritize.</p>
